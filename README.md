# pharmacy
This is a clone of Phamacy application using HTML,CSS and Bootstrap

The project involves creating a responsive pharmacy website using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap without relying on JavaScript. The website will be designed to provide an optimal viewing experience on both mobile and desktop devices. The HTML files will be structured to encompass various pages such as the home page, product listings, and a contact page. CSS will be applied to ensure a visually appealing design, and Bootstrap will be integrated for its front-end framework capabilities, facilitating a responsive layout. The project aims to achieve a consistent and user-friendly interface across different screen sizes, implementing Bootstrap components like navigation bars, cards, and forms. Special attention will be given to the responsive design to ensure the website functions seamlessly on both mobile and desktop views. Thorough testing will be conducted on various browsers and devices to guarantee cross-browser compatibility, and the final deployment will occur on a chosen web hosting platform. The project documentation will provide comprehensive insights into project setup, dependencies, and maintenance considerations. Overall, the goal is to deliver a static and responsive pharmacy website with an optimized viewing experience for both mobile and desktop users.
